However, there are considerable risks that come along with outsourcing software development. It can have adverse effects on the business and cause projects to fail before getting an opportunity to launch. Here are 5 major pitfalls to emphasize on when outsourcing software development:</p><p><strong>1.	Obstacles in communication - </strong>Though one of the biggest advantages with outsourcing software development lies in gaining access to global expertise, it also creates one of the major pitfalls - communication obstacles. As businesses are required to adapt to different time zones, language and culture. Maintaining regular coordination with the outsourcing party is of vital importance for ensuring project success.</p><p><strong>2.	Inability in understanding the project scope - </strong>Before outsourcing software development to a third-party, clarity about the requisites, expected deliverables, timeline and overall project scope is vital for effective outsourcing outcomes. Inadequacy in communication may lead to scope creep and misalignment to the product vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Without addressing these concerns, the software engineers will continue to work in silos causing the gap to increase between the expectations and the actual outcomes. Thus, transparency and vividity in documentation is fundamental in ensuring that the expectations and deliverables that the third-party offers complement each other.</p><p><strong>3.	Challenges in code quality -</strong> Identifying whether the outsourced party is adhering to the quality protocols while coding the app is a challenge that amplifies while working for a non-tech firm without optimum coding experience.</p><p><strong>4.	Unclarity of stakeholders -</strong>&nbsp;Lack of project autonomy is one of the biggest downfalls of outsourcing. If the outsourcing party that a business chooses to develop software programs is on contractual terms, the actual project ownership becomes tricky. Because there is no consistent team or project leader who is responsible for the work and is available throughout the entire development process.</p><p><strong>5.	Lacunas in contractual agreement -</strong> A fragile contract or the one that favours the contractor can result in lacunas that can be exploited by the outsourcing party and could lead to financial losses. A clearly drafted agreement serves as a roadmap for the outsourced party to abide by and protect the outsourcer from the burden of bearing heavy losses, if the things don\'t turn out right.</p><p><strong>The Bottom-Line</strong></p><p>It is important for an outsourcer to be aware of these challenges or cons. And ensure these drawbacks do not block the ways towards successful software development.</p><p><br></p>', NULL),

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.
